          <p>
            Welcome to the Overwatch Tranquility Community. This community is
            intended to aid in the growth of players and their development in
            the game of Overwatch. It was first conceived as a casual intramural
            level tournament but has evolved into a developmental community
            helping players across multiple skill tiers in a season style
            format.
          </p>

          <p>
            With that being said, Overwatch Tranquility is a well-organized
            community and will take the structure, branding, production and
            operation seriously. Itâ€™s a community that is meant to be fun and
            drama free, but that only works if everyone participates and follows
            the developed guidelines.
          </p>

          <p>
            After five successful seasons we are set to kick off Season 6
            February 10, 2020 with an expanded group that now contains 72 total
            teams across three tiers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Harmony Tier (2000-3000 w/ 2650 SR avg) Discord Tier (2800-3500 w/
            3200 SR avg) Transcendence Tier (3300-4000 w/ 3650 SR avg)
          </p>

          <p>
            The OWTC is open to all players in the Gold (2000 SR) to Masters
            (4000 SR) range, and it is meant to be an inclusive space to help
            build a community of competition and friendship.
