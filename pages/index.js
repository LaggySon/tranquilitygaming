          <p>
            Welcome to the Tranquility Gaming Community! This community is
            intended to aid in the growth of players, coaches, managers and
            associated contributors; furthering their development in online
            esports with a particular focus on Overwatch. Tranquility was first
            conceived as a casual intramural level tournament but has since
            evolved into a developmental community helping players across
            multiple games and skill tiers. Our Overwatch tournament currently
            runs over a 17 week season style format bi-annually.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tranquility is intended to be a well-organized community and will
            take structure, branding, production and operation seriously. Itâ€™s a
            community that is meant to be fun and drama free, but that only
            works if everyone participates and follows the developed guidelines.
            <br />
            <br />
            After eight successful seasons we are gearing up to kick off season
            9 this coming autumn 2022 with an expanded group that now contains
            five total tiers.
            <br />
            <br />
            NA & EU - Harmony Tier (2000-3000 w/ 2650 SR avg) <br />
            NA & EU - Discord Tier (2800-3500 w/ 3200 SR avg) <br />
            NA - Transcendence Tier (3300-4000 w/ 3750* SR avg)
            <br />
            <br />
            *Top six players only count towards team average.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tranquility Gaming is open to all players looking to help grow and
            expand esports. It is meant to be an inclusive space to help build a
            community of production, competition, and friendship.
            <br />
            <br />I look forward to meeting and interacting with you all, and I
            hope we can grow Tranquility into the best it can be!
            <br />
            <br />
            Regards, <br />
            Cavalier <br />
